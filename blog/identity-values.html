        <p>
          In my most recent job, I worked closely with artworks which often had
          specific limitations imposed on their display in my workplace (an art
          gallery) to ensure the artworks would not be damaged overtime by the
          surrounding environment. Last year, we invited in two guest curators
          to select artworks to be displayed in an exhibition, and I was
          responsible for coordinating and overseeing the exhibition
          installation.
        </p>

        <p>
          During this installation period, one of the guest curators insisted
          that we needed to brighten the lights above some old photographic
          artworks which had never been displayed in public before, and which
          had very specific maximum light levels which were safe for them to be
          exposed to. He thought that the room was too dark. My manager asked me
          to follow the guest curator's wishes and raise the light level on the
          artworks. Knowing that going above the max light levels could cause
          permanent damage to those artworks, I immediately went back to the
          loan agreement to check the limits on these artworks only to find that
          this was ambiguous; the lending institution had accidentally put two
          different max light level values into the agreement, and we didn't
          know which was correct.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was difficult to balance respecting the wishes of my manager and
          the guest curator, while also ensuring that I did not put the artworks
          in an unsafe situation. I asked that we hold off on raising the light
          levels until we had clarification from the lending institution on what
          the exact max safe light level was. There was a large time difference
          which delayed their response, so I had to be polite but firm on
          waiting and focusing on a different aspect of the installation until
          we had clarity. The guest curator and my manager felt that raising the
          lights briefly wouldn't be harmful, but I did not know this for
          certain and I didn't want to risk it when we could easily wait for
          clarification and had time to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          In retrospect, I am glad that I stuck to my values and did what I felt
          was right for the artworks. It wasn't easy to speak up against my
          manager and the guest curator, but ultimately we were being trusted by
          the lending insitution to care for these highly valuable and fragile
          artworks and I did not want to break that trust. In a gallery
          environment, staff protect people first, and then artworks; since no
          people were in danger in this situation, prioritising the artworks
          felt like the right thing to do and was my responsibility as a gallery
          staff member.

        <h2>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced

        <p>
          My mum has always been a good example to me about persisting through challenges with unapologetic
          indepencence and drive. A lot of my ambition and inner strength is
          modelled off her. I think I have always been open to other people's
          life experiences, but this open mindedness has definitely been
          strengthened by all the people I've befriended over the years. A lot
          of my past and current friends come from very different cultural and
          socioeconomic backgrounds to me. I have always been open and curious
          about their journeys and willing to listen and understand their
          backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          A big value of mine is compassion, which I think stems from the
          shyness and anxiety I experienced as a child. I remember a lot of the
          fears and difficulties I had and want to help others who have had
          similar experiences. Tutoring in University showed me that I love to
          help and guide people through things, whether academic or personal.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a child I was homeschooled for a decent chunk of my education, and
          was able to pursue whatever academic interests I had. I loved to
          explore the world and people's stories through reading, and really
          enjoyed history and art. This time in my life really nutured my
          enthusiasm for creativity and my imagination, and introduced me to the
          concept of learning at my own pace.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        When I was young I was shy, anxious and a real people pleaser, always
        worried about upsetting others to the extent that I could be
        self-sacrificing. As I grew up and experienced being taken advantage of,
        I gradually became more assertive and began to stand up for myself. It's
        really important to me to be in control of my own journey and identity,
        and to speak up when I or others are being wronged.

        <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>

        <p>I can be quick to frustration if something goes wrong. I need to remember to step back from a problem and give myself a break 
            when I'm not making headway.</p>
        <p>I can get anxious, withdrawn and worry that I won't figure something out, and then let that worry cloud my ability to problem 
          solve. I need to remember to trust the process and ask others for help when I'm really stuck.</p>
        <p>When I'm researching ways to fix/improve my code, often I over-complicate it and try to do something that is too overboard
          for the issue I'm having. I need to try and pull back from getting deep into an overly complex path, and try to see if there's 
          a simpler way to resolve an issue first.</p>
        <p>I can be quite hard on myself and it can affect my self-confidence, especially in an unfamiliar sector like this one. A big part
          of why I didn't try out development sooner was because I thought I was too 'artsy' and creative for the IT/Tech sector. If I 
          give in to the voice in my head which tries to discourage me and put me into a box, I can risk not taking opportunities I'd 
          actually do really well in. It's also important for me to remember that it's okay to fail, and that failure is actually an 
          opportunitiy for growth.</p>

        <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
          Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would

        <p>Last year there was a conflict which happened in my shared flat, where all of the flatmates disagreed about the best/safest 
          practices if one of us fell sick with covid. I ended up taking on a mediator role between my other flatmates, and encouraged
          them both to share their concerns and opinions. I wrote down what they both wanted, and then tried to find a middle ground we were
          all comfortable with. It worked well for some things we were concerned about, but there were still some things we just couldn't 
          all agree on and we kind of had to leave those things to one side.</p>
        <p>I think in retrospect, it would have been more effective for me to assert myself and add my voice to the conversation more 
          instead of mainly just listening and mediating. I think if I had added in more of my own opinions based on the current science, that may have helped resolve some of the issues we just weren't agreeing on. I also think it would have 
          been important to recognise when the discussion was no longer productive, and to remind everyone to take a break and cool off 
          a bit before reconvening.</p>
