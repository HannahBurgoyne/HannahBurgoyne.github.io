        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

        <p>
          My long-term goal is still to work in the tech industry as a
          developer. After the work I've done in Foundations, I now feel open to
          working either as a web or software developer. Ideally I'd still like
          to work for a company which focuses on building websites/apps/software
          for users, and be part of a wider development team co-working on
          projects.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h2>

        <p>
          I think my biggest strengths will be working well with others,
          collaborating on solutions to technical challenges, coming up with
          creative ways to approach a problem. My previous experience working in
          a small team for six years, where we frequently problem-solved
          together on projects, is something I anticipate being very beneficial
          at Bootcamp.
        </p>

        <p>
          My biggest limitations will probably be not comparing my progress to
          others, and not being afraid to contribute my own thoughts and ideas
          to the group. Sometimes I shoot my own ideas down before even sharing
          them, only to find that someone else voices the same idea. I'll need
          to remember that just because I'm still learning doesn't mean I don't
          have worthy ideas to contribute.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </h2>

        <p>
          I think the change in workload, and the increasing difficulty of the
          coursework, could have an emotional toll. I think remembering to stay
          positive and encourage myself through these challenges may be
          difficult as I adjust to the pace of Bootcamp. What I do think will
          help with this is being surrounded by the rest of my cohort and
          working together to get through challenging projects. Being there
          together in person will really help remind me that I'm not alone, and
          we're all in the same boat.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>

        <p>
          I'd really like to build up my confidence in sharing my thoughts and
          ideas in a tech-specific context, and learn how to pair programme well
          with others. I haven't had the opportunity to work with others in a
          tech environment properly yet, so I think that will be a really
          valuable experience to have.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'd also like to work on figuring out what my place will be in the
          tech industry, and how I can integrate my skillset from my previous
          work experience into my new career path. I feel like I've got a lot
          more human skills than tech skills from my previous work experience,
          so I mainly want to brush up on my technical skills at Bootcamp and
          find out how my human skills fit into a tech-oriented environment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>

        <p>
          I expect opportunities for technical and emotional support during the
          process of Bootcamp, and regular check-ins both in groups and
          one-on-one. I also expect to be able to ask for help when I need it,
          and to get feedback on the coursework I submit. I'd like to regularly
          get a sense of where I'm at, and how my progress is going.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>

        <p>
          In my Foundations plan I said that I am treating this as my full-time
          job, and I will be continuing this mindset throughout Bootcamp.
          Treating this as as my job means that I will uphold myself to a strong
          set of standards, as outlined below.
        </p>

        <p>
          I expect myself to manage my time well and respect the Bootcamp
          schedule, and the schedules of my facilitators and peers, by arriving
          on time in the mornings and turning all coursework in on time. If this
          is not possible, I expect myself to communicate this ahead of time
          professionally and as soon as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          I expect myself to be friendly, professional and warm at all times,
          and to remain positive in moments of stress. I also expect myself to
          work well with others on my team and to respect their opinions and
          ideas, and to give and receive feedback in a constructive and gracious
          manner.
        </p>

        <p>
          I expect myself to give all Tech and Core challenges my best efforts,
          and to keep an open mind during the course of my learning. I will
          remain dedicated to getting the best learning I can out of the
          coursework at Bootcamp, and consider how I can use my learnings going
          forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          I will seek support if I am stuck or blocked, and will raise any
          concerns I have with the facilitators in a timely and constructive
          manner.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, I'll remember to enjoy this learning journey and soak up
          every moment!

        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

        <p>
          My long-term plan beyond Dev Academy is to enter the tech industry as
          a web developer. I really enjoy working on projects for others and
          helping them to realise their vision - it's something I did in a
          different context during my previous line of work before coming to Dev
          Academy, when I was working in an art gallery. As part of a team I set
          up and installed audiovisual installations to meet respective artists'
          specifications, based on their vision for how their artwork would look
          installed in a gallery setting. With the skills I gain from
          Foundations and Bootcamp, I would love to work with a team of fellow
          developers to realise clients' visions for their websites, and
          contribute to building and maintaining the web.

        <h2>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h2>

        <p>
          I learn really well by trying something out and tinkering with it.
          Before enrolling here I was tasked at my former workplace to set up a
          new website using Wordpress and the Divi theme. I had never build a
          website before, but I began learning how to use the CMS and the basics
          of building a site by experimenting with different strategies and
          designs, doing a lot of online research and having many conversations
          with my manager on what her vision was for the website and its
          content. Ultimately I found that trying out a piece of code really
          helped me understand how it worked. I continued with this learning
          strategy when I did some further interactive courses through
          FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project, picking up further CSS skills and
          diving into JavaScript for the first time. I also find visual content
          really helpful in supporting my learning process, which I think is
          part of why website development appeals to me - being able to test
          something out in Dev Tools and seeing it update visually in the
          browser window helps me understand what my code is actually doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          When something isn't working how I expect, it can be a challenge for
          me to not clam up and try to problem solve it entirely on my own
          instead of asking for help. I have a tendency to get lost in what I'm
          doing and become entirely fixated on it, to the extent that I can
          forget to take breaks or be unable to mentally step away from the
          issue and give my brain a rest. In the past I've always found myself
          coding and problem solving alone, and had to be entirely reliant on
          myself and the internet. I'm keen to work on reaching out for support
          and asking others for their advice on my code. I'd also like to work
          more on not comparing my own learning journey to others, and to be
          inspired by others' creations rather than comparing theirs to my own.
        </p>

          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>

        <p>
          One of my main goals at Dev Academy is to learn how to program and
          problem solve with others as part of a team. I've worked in teams
          before but never in a tech-oriented environment, so I believe this
          will be a very valuable aspect of my learning journey and it's a big
          part of why I enroled in the first place. I know from my past work
          experience that teamwork is extremely important in any profession, and
          by learning to code at home on my own I was missing out on that aspect
          of retraining as a developer. I've never really gotten feedback on my
          code before, so this is a great opportunity to learn to recieve and
          give feedback and to put it to use constructively.

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
        </h2>

        <p>
          I am treating my time at Dev Academy as my full-time job. This means
          that I have a Monday - Friday 9am - 5pm routine during which I will be
          focused and ready to work, and will write myself a list of daily goals
          and evaluate this at the end of each day. I will take my work
          seriously, and put my best effort into everything I do. I will track
          my time and be focused on the course content, and engage with my
          peers. I will take breaks when I need them and practice self-care to
          sustain myself through each challenge which comes my way. If I am
          unable to meet a deadline, I will speak to my Facilitator ahead of
          time and discuss what can be done. I will always engage with my peers,
          Facilitators and industry/community representatives in a professional
          and warm manner, as I would do in my personal and professional life.
        </p>

        <p>
          When things are getting challenging and overwhelming, I will take a
          productive and constructive approach. I will take a break, recognise
          when I am out of my depth, and reach out to my Facilitator(s) for
          guidance and discuss the best path forward. I will be ready and
          willing to make any suggested changes to my schedule and/or time
          management to help ease the pressure.

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>

        <p>
          I will seek help when I am unable to resolve a problem on my own, and
          will reach out in a timely fashion to my peers and Facilitators on
          Discord (during Foundations) or in person (during Bootcamp). I will
          describe my issue as best as I can, ask clarifying questions and try
          out suggested ideas to see if they work. I am grateful for any help I
          receive, and will try to give help as often as I can in return.

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">

          I expect the Facilitators to continue to keep up the great work in

          myself and my peers each week to check in with us and help us where
          needed.

        <p>
          I am fortunate to have no regular commitments at present outside of
          Dev Academy. I am single, flatting, and have no dependents. However, I
          will be mindful of any upcoming commitments such as appointments and
          social activities, and will plan around these. Where possible I will
          try to schedule these outside of 9am - 5pm weekdays, but when this is
          not possible I will ensure it doesn't intefere with my ability to
          complete my work and I will comunicate any clashes with the
          Foundations/Bootcamp schedule as far ahead of time as possible to my
          Facilitators.
