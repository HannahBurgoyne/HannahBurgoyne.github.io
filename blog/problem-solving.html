        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          This week we had the pleasure of wringing our brains out and hanging
          them up to dry - aka going through a series of JavaScript Kata
          challenges. The term 'kata' derives from Japanese martial arts, and
          essentially means practising different skills through a series of
          repetitive challenges. In a programming context, these types of
          challenges are an important way of learning how to problem solve
          effectively and improve your process - to hopefully avoid the
          brain-mashing that inevitably happens during the learning stages of
          JavaScript!
        </p>

        <p>
          Below I'll share my experience problem solving this week's Kata
          challenges, and reflect on what worked for me, what needs improving,
          and what I'll keep in mind for next time I charge face first at an
          array of objects while screaming.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>The Gradebook challenges should be simple... right?</h2>
        <p>Spoiler alert: they were not!</p>

        <p>
          I went into section 4 of Javascript Kata thinking that it was going to
          be a lot easier than it ended up being. For this section I was tasked
          with creating a virtual gradebook and writing a function which
          automatically adds a list of students, and their corresponding scores,
          into it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The gradebook had to be represented as an object in Javascript (an
          item which stores different types of sub-data), and I've worked with
          objects before so I felt confident about this. I created a new
          'gradebook' object to store all my data about the students and their
          scores, so far so good. However, I soon realised that each of the
          challenges would require writing a function which a: looped through
          the object, and b: added the students and their scores in on each loop
          - something I was much less familiar with!
        </p>

        <p>
          I used a variety of techniques to muddle through this. First, I
          thought over the content I've learnt over the past week and a half at
          Dev Academy, some of which had already involved similar challenges. I
          revised some of this content and wrote a plan of attack using
          pseudocode (comments in my code file written in plain English,
          detailing step by step what I wanted my function to do). Once I had an
          initial plan in place, I spent a lot of time researching methods to
          add data to objects, accessing existing data in objects, and looping
          through objects. I read some very helpful articles on websites like
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>and
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a>. Once I began
          writing out code it took a long time to figure out the correct syntax
          for the types of loops I was using, and I was really confused about
          how to make sure each list of students corresponded to their correct
          list of test scores. I ended up using a really handy command
          <code>console.log</code> a lot, to show me what my function was
          currently outputting, and I talked myself through my code out loud,
          step by step. That helped me visualise what the computer was actually
          doing with my function and how I needed to fix it. When I got really
          stuck I posted on Dev Academy's Discord channels asking for help and
          sharing my current code. This really helped me get some ideas I hadn't
          already thought of.
        </p>

        <p>
          I felt a lot of emotions throughout this process. The biggest one was
          definitely frustration when I felt completely stuck! It was difficult
          sometimes to not lose my patience, and I got stressed worrying that I
          wouldn't be able to find the right solution. Sometimes I felt some
          despair over my own abilities, and concern that I was the only one
          struggling. Ultimately reaching out for help alleviated that, as I
          could see that my peers were also asking similar questions to me and
          that we were all in the same boat. On the bright side, when I solved a
          problem and saw the little tests we needed to pass turn green - that
          was so exciting! I felt so proud of myself every time I passed another
          test, not to mention relieved.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately I learnt to be patient and keep encouraging myself through
          the rough parts, trusting that I'd figure it out eventually. I also
          realised the value of reshuffling my code around to see if that helped
          - there were a few times when I had the right idea, but just didn't
          get the right order of code statements in my function initially! By
          the end of the Gradebook challenges I felt like I'd learnt so much
          more about looping through objects and arrays using a few different
          methods, like
          <code>forEach</code> and <code>for... of</code>, and I ended up
          feeling much more confident with these kinds of loops.
        </p>

        <h2>Bouncing back and winning the JS Olympics</h2>

        <p>
          By the time I'd finished the Gradebook challenges, my brain felt like
          it'd gone through a cement mixer twice. I mostly got through the other
          challenges okay, but things finally, really began to click when I got
          to the final section of Javascript Kata: the JS Olympics. Sounds
          intimidating, right? And I was definitely nervous. But what followed
          was probably one of my proudest moments of the last couple of weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing on all the lessons I'd learnt from sucking at the previous
          challenges, I rolled up my sleeves and started coding - and suddenly,
          I no longer sucked. I'm particularly proud of my solution for
          challenge 2, which tasked me with writing a function called
          <code>unjumble</code>
          which takes a string (a sentence, or a word) and reverses it so it
          comes out spelled backwards.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I first started learning Javascript last year, I came across a
          similar string reversal challenge elsewhere. I remember how much of a
          struggle it was to understand how to even begin attempting something
          like this, and how reliant I was on other people's solutions to the
          problem before I could even begin to code. This time was different - I
          went into the challenge having a rough idea of what I'd need to do:
          break up the string into an array (aka a list) of individual letters,
          reverse the order of the array, and then join all the letters back up
          together and convert it back into a string once more.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wasted no time in going to Google and looking up different methods
          of changing around arrays. JavaScript has some really handy
          pre-conceived methods which I'd already been using in one of the
          earlier Kata challenges, so that was also very helpful knowledge to
          build on. From the outside I knew I'd need to use a method called
          <code>.split()</code> to break the string up into an array, so I went
          ahead and wrote that out and was delighted to find it worked exactly
          as I envisioned. Next, I looked through methods for reversing the
          array list on
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>. Last
          time I solved this challenge, I remember having a pretty convoluted
          process: looping through the array and shifting each letter from the
          start to the end, and then pushing the letters in their new order into
          a new array which I then used as my final result. This was perfectly
          acceptable, but I felt like I could do one better. I ended up finding
          a nifty method called <code>.reverse()</code> - which does what it
          says on the tin! After that, it was just a matter of rejoining up all
          the letters and turning it back into a string, and returning the
          result.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I was problem solving this challenge, I felt proud of how far I had
          come. A year ago reversing a string was such a daunting task, and yet
          here I was now not just solving it, but thinking about the cleanest
          and easiest way to do so with the new knowledge I possessed. It felt
          great to recognise my progress with JavaScript, particularly as I
          still have a lot of moments where I struggle with it.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I learnt was that I'm doing a lot better at this coding thing
          then I give myself credit for! This challenge really showed me how
          much knowledge my brain has actually soaked in about JavaScript, much
          more than I had realised. A little confidence went a long way for me
          in that challenge, and it spurred me on to do really well with the
          following challenges - ultimately ending JS Kata on a high note.
        </p>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>Problem solving techniques</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Psuedocode:</strong> This is one I use a lot nowadays, and I
          feel pretty confident with it. It tends to be the first thing I do
          when I approach a problem - it's a lot easier to code if you're
          following a recipe.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Trying something out:</strong> This is probably about 90% of
          my coding process. Sometimes it can be frustrating if I've tried lots
          of things and none of them are working, but every so often there's a
          ray of light when something does work - and that's enough to keep me
          trying new things!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> A classic which I'm still
          building up confidence with. In the past I've used an AI like ChatGPT
          to explain my code to me as if I'm the rubber duck, but now I try to
          explain my code to myself instead of relying on a robot to do it for
          me. It's slowly helping me read my code better and means I take the
          time to make sure I actually understand the logic.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> Another one I'm still
          learning! Error messages can be super helpful, especially when they
          catch a bracket I've missed or a word I've misspelled. But sometimes
          they can still feel confusing - I usually try Googling the error
          message to see if that helps shed more light on things.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Console.logging:</strong> My absolute favourite technique! I'm
          really used to HTML and CSS, where it's easy to visualise the output
          of your code and make adjustments as necessary. JavaScript doesn't
          always make it so easy, but using <code>console.log</code> gives me a
          window into my code's current output so I can see exactly what's
          working and what isn't. Having that clear visualisation of what
          adjustments I need to make is truly invaluable. Definitely feeling
          confident with this one!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Googling:</strong> Another one I use all the time - honestly,
          I think I've spent more hours Googling how to fix my code than I have
          actually coding! I feel like I'm getting better at writing a clear
          Google search which gets me relevant articles. I especially look for
          results from
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs,</a>
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools,</a> and
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">freeCodeCamp.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> This works as long as I
          don't let my ego get in the way! Sometimes I feel a bit embarrassed
          asking for help, especially if no one else appears to have done so.
          It's never easy being the first one to reach out. But what's really
          helping me get more confident in asking for help is seeing how many
          other people are doing the same, and remembering that all of us are
          learning and it's a safe space to get support.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> I think I often find this
          easier than reaching out to my peers, especially if it's in a
          one-on-one setting with a facilitator. It's something I've gotten
          pretty confident at thankfully!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> I really got
          to practice this one during the challenges this week! I'd never really
          reflected too strongly on my problem solvingprocess before coming to
          Dev Academy. This week spending some time going over my process at the
          end of each challenge, and thinking about what went well and what
          didn't, really helped me improve for the challenges ahead. This one is
          still quite new but I feel like I'm already seeing the benefits of
          reflecting.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>When I found it hard to ask for help</h2>
        <p>
          This topic actually takes me back to Sprint 2 of Foundations, when I
          was creating this website from scratch and finding it to be a bigger
          challenge than I'd expected! There was a point where my website wasn't
          being responsive and I couldn't understand what was causing the issue.
          I felt very confident about my experience with HTML and CSS, so when
          things were going wrong it was hard to not feel like I was failing at
          the easiest thing. It felt embarrassing to ask for help for something
          I thought I wouldn't need help with.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a valuable lesson for me that all developers need help at some
          stage, no matter their skillset or experience. I wasn't an idiot just
          because something wasn't working - it was just an issue I hadn't
          personally come across before! Once I'd reached out for help I felt so
          much better, it was like a weight lifted. Next time I'll ask sooner
          and not beat myself up about it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>

        <p>
          The Kata challenges, while sometimes frustratingly hard, were
          ultimately really helpful in understanding where I'm at with
          JavaScript. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I bounced back
          after my struggles in the first half of the challenges - maybe my
          brain just needed some time to warm up!
        </p>

        <p>
          When I next try some Kata challenges out, I'll make sure I keep
          encouraging myself, using the problem solving techniques I discussed
          above, and taking plenty of breaks to avoid getting too in my head
          about it all. It may have been an ordeal at times, but ultimately I
          had a lot of fun - and I honestly can't wait to get stuck in to some
          challenges again!
