        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          When we style code, we need to let our stylesheet know which elements
          of our webpage we want it to style. That's where class and ID
          selectors come in.
        </p>

        <p>
          Generally speaking, class and ID selectors are the names we give to
          specific elements in our HTML code. For example, we can create a
          <code>div</code> container and give it the name <code>pink-div</code>.
          When we then go into our CSS file and write some style rules for
          <code>pink-div</code>
          (such as giving it a padding of 5px, making the background colour pink
          and giving it a fuschia border), those style rules will only be
          applied to any element which is named <code>pink-div</code>. This
          means we can style specific elements in a lot of different ways,
          creating visually unique sections and pages on a website.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this blog post, we'll be exploring the key differences between a
          class and an ID, and then we'll delve into the best practices for each
          of these.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>What is a class?</h2>

        <p>
          If you want to apply the exact same set of style rules to lots of
          different HTML elements, then using the class selector is the right
          choice. The class selector represents a 'class' of elements which all
          share the same styles, and it's handy because you only need to define
          those styles once in your CSS code to apply them multiple times in
          your HTML code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's say that you want to style a main menu. Each item in your menu
          ('Home', 'About', etc) has the exact same name: "menu-item". This is
          because we want each of our menu items to look and work exactly the
          same on our website.
        </p>

        <div class="code-example">
          <pre>
          <code>
            &#x3C;ul&#x3E;
            &#x3C;li class=&#x22;menu-item&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;#&#x22;&#x3E;Home&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
            &#x3C;li class=&#x22;menu-item&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;#&#x22;&#x3E;About&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
            &#x3C;li class=&#x22;menu-item&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;#&#x22;&#x3E;Articles&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
            &#x3C;li class=&#x22;menu-item&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;#&#x22;&#x3E;Item&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
            &#x3C;/ul&#x3E;
          </code>
        </pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          Now, we can go into our CSS stylesheet and create a set of rules for
          our menu items.
        </p>

        <div class="code-example">
          <pre>
          <code>
            .menu-item {
              padding: 8px;
              width: 100%;
              color: pink;
            }
        </code>
        </pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          Once we save that and refresh, you'll see that all of the items with
          the class 'menu-item' now look identical. That's the magic of using a
          class!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>What is an ID?</h2>

        <p>
          Let's say that we want to style the overall look of the main menu
          itself. Because the main menu is going to be the only element which
          will have this style applied to it, we don't need to ensure this style
          can be used elsewhere on the page. That's where the ID selector comes
          in.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ID selector works in a very similar way to the class selector, but
          there's a key difference. You can only use an ID to style a
          <strong>single element</strong> in your HTML code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our overall main menu has an ID called " ", and we are only going to
          use this name once in our HTML code.
        </p>

        ``` code here ```

        <p>
          Now, let's go into our CSS stylesheet again. We can create a set of
          rules for " " as well, but notice the difference in syntax. By using a
          '#' instead of a '.', we're telling the stylesheet that this
          particular set of style rules is an ID selector and will therefore
          only be used <strong>once</strong> in our HTML code.
        </p>

        ``` code here ```

        <p>
          When we save this and refresh our webpage, you'll see that we now have
          our style applied to the main menu element on our webpage. The class
          and ID selectors essentially function in the same way, but it's how
          you use them that counts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>Best practices</h2>

        <p>
          You should always reserve ID selectors for styling a single element in
          your HTML code. If you know you'll only be using a specific element
          once (such as the main menu from our earlier example), then go ahead
          and use an ID selector for this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Class selectors are best to use when you have lots of elements in your
          HTML code which will need to share the same style (such as our menu
          items from our earlier example).
        </p>

        <p>
          Ensuring that you use each of these selectors in the correct
          situations will make your code cleaner, optimised and easier for other
          developers to read.
        </p>

        <p>Here's an example of what not to do:</p>

        ``` code here ```

        <p>
          Versus what this code can be cleaned up with best practice applied:
        </p>

        ``` code here ```

        <p>
          It's also important to think about the order of operations when you
          write your CSS code. When your browser interprets CSS, it looks over
          all the selectors and determines the order of operations it will
          'cascade' in. ID selectors always take priority over class selectors
          in CSS code.
