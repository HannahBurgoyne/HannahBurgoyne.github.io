        <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>

        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is all about being aware of your own emotions,
          and the emotions of others. Those high in emotional intelligence are
          able to reflect on their feelings mindfully, regulate their emotions
          and understand where these are stemming from, and respond
          appropriately.
        </p>

        <p>Some traits of emotionally intelligent people are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The ability to think mindfully and reflectively about their emotions
            and those of others, improving their ability to relate to others in
            an effective, constructive way
          </li>
          <li>
            Control and regulation of their own emotions, being understanding of
            their own and other's emotions, and knowing how to respond
          </li>
          <li>
            Identifying and describing how others are feeling, and knowing their
            own strengths and limits
          </li>
          <li>
            Accepting their emotions, reactions and those of others, with
            curiosity rather than judgement
          </li>
          <li>
            Practising self-compassion, while also having empathy and concern
            for others
          </li>
          <li>
            Taking responsibility for their mistakes and learning from them
          </li>
          <li>
            Being aware of and managing their emotions in difficult moments
          </li>
          <li>
            Actively listening to others and being present in the moment with
            them
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          EQ (Emotional Quotient) accounts for more of your thinking and
          interpersonal abilities than just a traditional assessment of your
          intelligence (IQ). IQ tests tend to focus on your ability to logically
          problem solve, learn, strategise, understand abstract ideas, and your
          applied use of language. This is very much a traditional and academic
          model of assessing your abilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          EQ takes this further and considers your emotional intelligence about
          yourself and others, including abilities such as identifying and
          reflecting on your emotions and those of others, empathising with
          others, adapting your behaviour and feelings to different situations,
          impulse control and emotional regulation, conflict resolution and
          effective communication including active listening, and being fully,
          mindfully present in the moment with others.
        </p>

        <p>
          In both IQ and EQ assessments, your ability to problem solve can be
          tested. The key difference is that in IQ tests you'd be problem
          solving something more technical or logical, such as a mathematics
          problem, whereas in EQ tests you'd be assessed on your ability to
          problem solve an interpersonal issue such as a conflict between
          yourself and another person.

        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>

        <p>
          When you work at a company, you're usually always working as part of a
          team of people. The overall productivity and success of the company
          depends on everyone getting along, working effectively together,
          communicating well, and handling conflict resolution in an appropriate
          and professional manner. Having a high EQ demonstrates that you'll be
          able to work well within a company's existing team, adapt to the
          interpersonal environment of the office and therefore produce
          effective, good quality work in collaboration with your coworkers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only does having a high EQ improve your professional life, it can
          have a hugely beneficial impact on your personal life too. Emotional
          intelligent people tend to experience better mental health, have more
          satisfying relationships with others, and cope better when faced with
          challenging life situations. Emotional intelligence can also improve
          your ability to mediate arguments and improve your overall
          self-confidence.
        </p>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>What are some ways to improve your emotional intelligence?</h2>

        <p>
          To know and accept others, it's important to understand and accept
          yourself. Practising mindfulness through a regular meditation habit is
          a great way to check in with yourself. Mindfulness involves actively
          recognising and accepting any thoughts or feelings, no matter how
          challenging or uncomfortable they may be, and sitting with these
          quietly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Practising actively listening to others nutures your ability to
          empathise, relate to, and commmunicate mindfully with your peers.
          Sitting and listening to a friend, colleague or loved one speak for a
          while without being poised to reply to their opinions and thoughts,
          can give you a greater appreciation for their perspective and a better
          overall understanding of who they are and where they are coming from.
          It also becomes an important skill when resolving interpersonal
          conflict.
        </p>

        <p>
          Allowing yourself to feel your emotions when they surface is an
          important step in becoming better at self-regulation. When we push
          down our negative emotions and bottle them up, they rise again sooner
          or later and are usually stronger than before. This can lead to
          greater pain than if we had let them out in the first place.
          Identifying your present emotion, letting it wash over you and
          venting/crying/writing about how it makes you feel and the thoughts
          which come up is a very cathartic experience. You're likely to feel
          much better afterwards.
        </p>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>To sum up</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is not a skill we are born with, but an
          important one which we can foster over the course of our lives.
          Understanding your own emotions and those of others is not just a
          great skill to help you succeed in the workplace, but a valuable tool
          to help you weather all the personal and professional challenges of
          life - while also giving you a greater appreciation for all the joys.
