        <h2>The DOM, HTML, and CSS</h2>

        <p>
          Imagine a large, mature tree filled with branches and leaves. Unlike
          most trees you come across, this one has been built from a blueprint -
          a large diagram which sets out all the individual elements of the
          tree, all planned out before it grew. Each leaf is an element, some
          unique, some alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tree's overall appearance and decoration has been also been
          preconceived. The colours in every leaf, the positioning of each
          branch, and the width of the trunk, have all been decided by a set of
          style guidelines written out on a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, imagine you want to make some changes to the tree even though it
          has already grown up. Maybe you could make these to the blueprint, but
          that's not really the most practical way to do things now that the
          tree has grown. Instead, you gather some tools and you begin pruning
          the tree. These are magical tools, which allow you to change the
          leaves from green to autumnal red, and to make a secret opening in the
          foot of the tree when a special button is pressed. Suddenly, the tree
          is transformed from a basic ordinary looking tree into something alive
          and interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          This analogy represents how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Document
          Object Model (DOM) work together. HTML is the blueprint which plans in
          advance how the tree should be structured and designed. CSS is the
          decorative styles applied to the tree, as a series of guidelines
          dictacting its appearance. The DOM is the tree itself, which it grows
          up (aka is parsed through the internet browser) as dictated by the
          HTML blueprint and the CSS style guidelines.And JavaScript is the
          tools you used to make alterations to the tree itself, allowing you to
          make changes to the tree and enrich the experience visitors have with
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model is the result of your web browser parsing an
          HTML document and using this to build a tree-like structure, or DOM,
          which allows you to interact with and manipulate elements of a
          webpage. The easiest way to access the DOM is to go into 'Developer
          Tools' in a web browser such as Google Chrome. A sidebar appears on
          the right-hand side of your screen, allowing you to click through all
          the elements and look at images of them. This is known as traversing
          (i.e. virtually exploring) the DOM.
        </p>

        <p>
          Traversing the DOM is a useful and even powerful way to interact with
          a website. Developer Tools allows you to temporarily change aspects of
          the DOM, giving you a virtual sandbox in which to test out potential
          changes to a webpage without altering the actual source code. For
          example, you could try out changing the background colour of your
          webpage to red, and rewrite some of the page's content. If you don't
          like the result, you can refresh the page and it will reverse all
          changes - giving you the opportunity to try a different approach until
          you find something you like enough to permanently code into your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a way of manipulating the DOM without needing to use Dev
          Tools all the time. It means that you can add interactivity into the
          source code of your website, such as writing a script which commands
          that when a button is pressed by the user, confetti rains down on the
          webpage. Or maybe all the text changes to bright green and dances
          around. The user is given a level of agency over how they interact
          with the webpage, and creative ways to engage with it which enhance
          how they take in the content.

        <h2>Control flow in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          When you go to the gym, you probably have a workout routine which you
          follow to get the most out of your time there. Maybe you start by
          warming up on the treadmill, and then do some exercises on the mat.
          Then you move on to the weights rack, and do some reps there. And
          maybe you finish with some lunges across the floor of the gym, before
          doing some stretches to warm down and then hit the showers. You keep
          it consistent and familiar, and you execute your planned workout
          smoothly and confidently, knowing exactly what you'll be doing when
          you do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now imagine if your computer went to the gym. Your computer has a
          workout plan all of their own, and they stick to it without fail every
          time - as long as the workout plan is in perfect order. When you write
          a JavaScript file, you're essentially writing a plan for your computer
          to execute. The computer will always execute the plan in order from
          top to bottom, and this is called control flow. Control flow is this
          ordered process of reading the computer follows, just as if we were
          reading a workout plan and doing all the exercises in order from start
          to finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Control flow runs smoothly until the computer encounters two things:
          conditionals and loops. Conditionals are statements in a JavaScript
          file, for example the <code>if... else</code> statement which contains
          a series of actions nested within it. The computer only executes these
          actions if the conditions are met. To return to our gym analogy, the
          computer gets to the section of their workout plan which reads: "if
          Bob is using the ab crunch machine, go and do 3 sets of 5 reps on
          rowing machine instead. Else, if Bob is not using the ab crunch
          machine, go and do 2 sets of 10 reps on there." The action your
          computer takes depends on which condition is met in this section of
          the plan. Thus, the control flow is altered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loops similarly change the computer's control flow. However, rather
          than the outcome being changed by a conditional statement, a loop
          tells the computer to keep executing a statement over and over until a
          certain set of conditions have been met. In our gym analogy, the
          computer gets to a section of their workout plan which reads: "Go to
          the weights rack. Deadlift this 10kg barbell over and over, and each
          time you lift it, add 1kg extra to the barbell. Repeat this until you
          are so exhausted you cannot lift anymore." The computer will obey and
          lift an increasingly heavy barbell until they meet the condition of
          being exhausted. Then, the computer will continue to execute the next
          exercises on the workout plan in a state of control flow, until it
          comes across a conditional and/or a loop once again.
