        <h2>Using JavaScript with the DOM, HTML, and CSS</h2>

        <p>
          Imagine a large, mature tree filled with branches and leaves. Unlike
          most trees you come across, this one has been built from a blueprint -
          a large diagram which sets out all the individual elements of the
          tree, all planned out before it grew. Each leaf is an element, some
          unique, some alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tree's overall appearance and decoration has been also been
          preconceived. The colours in every leaf, the positioning of each
          branch, and the width of the trunk, have all been decided by a set of
          style guidelines written out on a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, imagine you want to make some changes to the tree even though it
          has already grown up. Maybe you could make these to the blueprint, but
          there's a more exciting way to do it. Instead, you gather some tools
          and you begin pruning the tree. These are magical tools, which allow
          you to change the leaves from green to autumnal red, and to make a
          secret opening in the foot of the tree when a special button is
          pressed. Suddenly, the tree is transformed from a basic ordinary
          looking tree into something alive and interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          This analogy represents how <strong>HTML</strong>,
          <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and the
          <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> work together.
          <strong>HTML</strong> is the blueprint which plans in advance how the
          tree should be structured and designed. <strong>CSS</strong> is the
          decorative styles applied to the tree, as a series of guidelines
          dictacting its appearance. The <strong>DOM</strong> is the tree
          itself, which it grows up (aka is parsed through the internet browser)
          as dictated by the HTML blueprint and the CSS style guidelines. And
          <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the tools you used to make alterations
          to the tree itself, allowing you to enrich the experience visitors
          have with it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>Exploring the DOM</h2>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model is the result of your web browser parsing an
          HTML document and using this to build a tree-like structure, which
          allows you to interact with and manipulate elements of a webpage. The
          easiest way to access the DOM is to go into 'Developer Tools' in a web
          browser such as Google Chrome. A sidebar appears on the right-hand
          side of your screen, allowing you to click through all the elements
          and look at images of them. This is known as
          <strong>traversing</strong> (i.e. virtually exploring) the DOM.
        </p>

        <p>
          Traversing the DOM is a useful and even powerful way to interact with
          a website. Developer Tools allows you to temporarily change aspects of
          the DOM, giving you a virtual sandbox in which to test out potential
          changes to a webpage without altering the actual source code. For
          example, you could try out changing the background colour of your
          webpage to red, and rewrite some of the page's content. If you don't
          like the result, you can refresh the page and it will reverse all
          changes - giving you the opportunity to try a different approach until
          you find something you like enough to permanently code into your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a way of manipulating the DOM without needing to use Dev
          Tools all the time. It means that you can add interactivity into the
          source code of your website, such as writing a script which commands
          that when a button is pressed by the user, confetti rains down on the
          webpage. Or maybe all the text changes to bright green and dances
          around. The user is given a level of agency over how they interact
          with the webpage, and creative ways to engage with it which enhance
          how they take in the content.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a particular way in which your computer reads JavaScript, and
          this is a key aspect of ensuring a webpage's interactive elements run
          just as you planned them to.

        <h2>Control flow in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          When you go to the gym, you probably have a workout routine which you
          follow to get the most out of your time there. Maybe you start by
          warming up on the treadmill, and then do some exercises on the mat.
          Then you move on to the weights rack, and do some reps there. And
          maybe you finish with some lunges across the floor of the gym, before
          doing some stretches to warm down and then hit the showers. You keep
          it consistent and familiar so that you can execute your planned
          workout smoothly and confidently, knowing exactly what you'll be doing
          and when you'll do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now imagine if your computer went to the gym. Your computer has a
          workout plan all of their own, and they stick to it without fail every
          time - as long as the workout plan is in perfect order. When you write
          a JavaScript file, you're essentially writing a plan for your computer
          to execute. The computer will always execute the plan in order from
          top to bottom, and this is called control flow. Control flow is this
          ordered process of reading which the computer follows, just as if we
          were reading a workout plan and doing all the exercises in order from
          start to finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Control flow runs smoothly until the computer encounters one of two
          things: <strong>conditionals</strong> and <strong>loops</strong>.
          <strong>Conditionals</strong> are statements in a JavaScript file, for
          example the <code>if... else</code> statement which contains a series
          of actions nested within it. The computer only executes these actions
          if the conditions are met. To return to our gym analogy, the computer
          gets to the section of their workout plan which reads:
          <code
            >"If Bob is using the ab crunch machine, go and do 3 sets of 5 reps
            on the rowing machine instead. Else, if Bob is not using the ab
            crunch machine, go and do 2 sets of 10 reps on there."</code
          >
          The action your computer takes depends on which condition is met in
          this section of the plan. Thus, the control flow is altered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Loops</strong> similarly change the computer's control flow.
          However, rather than the outcome being changed by a conditional
          statement, a loop tells the computer to keep executing a statement
          over and over until a certain set of conditions have been met. In our
          gym analogy, the computer gets to a section of their workout plan
          which reads:
          <code
            >"Go to the weights rack. Deadlift this 10kg barbell over and over,
            and each time you lift it, add 1kg extra to the barbell. Repeat this
            until you are so exhausted that you cannot lift anymore."</code
          >
          The computer will obey and lift an increasingly heavy barbell until
          they meet the condition of being exhausted. Then, the computer will
          cease the loop and continue on to execute the next exercises on the
          workout plan in a state of control flow, until it comes across a
          conditional and/or a loop once again.
        </p>

        <h2>Accessing Arrays and Objects with JavaScript</h2>

        <p>
          When we write JavaScript, often we have a bunch of data which we want
          to store for reference so we can access it again later in our file.
          This is where <strong>arrays</strong> and
          <strong>objects</strong> come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <strong>array</strong> is a list of items contained within square
          brackets. Think of a bunch of fruits, for example. If you have a
          pineapple, a banana, a mango, and an orange, they all fall under the
          category of 'fruit', but are also items in their own right. Here's how
          we would represent that in JavaScript:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
            Array example here  
          </code></pre>
        <p>
          Each item in the array corresponds to a zero-based index - a series of
          numbers beginning from zero, which indicate the position of an item in
          an array. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          Index example here 
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          This index comes in handy when you need to access items within an
          array. Simply place the index number corresponding to the item you
          want to access, in square brackets after the name of the array. Like
          so:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          Accessing array element example here 
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          You can also, if you wish, access the entire array by referring to it
          by its name. This will correspond to the entire list of items.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <strong>object</strong> also stores a bunch of items, but is
          structured differently from an array. An object stores not only a list
          of items (<strong>properties</strong>), but also some data unique to
          each item in that list (<strong>values</strong>). Think of a real-life
          object, like a bed. A bed is made up of lots of smaller items, like
          the mattress (which is springy), the pillows (which are soft), the
          bed-frame(which is wooden), and the sheets (which are blue). If we
          were to represent this bed as an object in JavaScript, here's what it
          would look like:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
            Object here  
          </code></pre>
        <p>
          To access the properties within an object, you have the option of
          using two different types of notation. Although the syntax differs,
          each method ultimately accesses the object property in the same way.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          Bracket and dot notation examples here  
        </code></pre>
      </div>

        <h2>Creating and using functions</h2>

        <p>
          Sometimes, we write a particular set of instructions for our computer
          to execute, and we want to save that set and call on our computer to
          use it again at another point in our JavaScript file. That's where
          <strong>functions</strong> really come in handy.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>function</strong> is a section of code which is designed to
          perform a specific task. For example, you may want your computer to
          multiply two numbers, and return the answer. Let's say that you want
          your computer to perform this task not only once, but anytime you ask
          it to within your JavaScript file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of writing out the same piece of code multiple times, you can
          use a function. Here's an example below:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          Function example here   
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          The beauty of a function really becomes apparent when you make use of
          <strong>parameters</strong>, aka the content you put inside the
          brackets after the name of the function. By typing placeholder names
          into these brackets, and then using those placeholder names throughout
          the function to indicate specific actions, you can ask the computer to
          execute the task using any values you place inside those brackets. For
          example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          Function example here   
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Further along in your JavaScript file, you can call this function and
          give it some unique parameters, and it will execute the function task
          for you using those specific parameters. This is great for creating
          all kinds of interactive tools and elements on a website, such as
          convertor which converts whatever temperature/measurement/time you
          input to the equivalent temperature/measurement/time in another unit
          standard, or an alert that you can customise to say any message you
          write into it. A group of functions all executing different sets of
          actions, all within one JavaScript file, can even become components of
          an interactive game. The possibilities are endless!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>Putting it all together!</h2>
        <p>
          All the topics we've discussed above are frequently used together to
          create interactive website experiences. As mentioned, the
          <strong>DOM</strong> builds a working tree from its
          <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> sourcecode. A developer
          can then access this tree to test things out, or can write
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>
          code which manipulates parts of this tree through commands. Within the
          JavaScript code, a developer can store data within
          <strong>arrays</strong> and/or <strong>objects</strong>, and this data
          can then be accessed and manipulated through tasks contained and
          repeated within a series of <strong>functions</strong> called upon
          throughout the script. The computer will read the JavaScript file from
          top to bottom and execute commands in its
          <strong>control flow</strong> state, bringing the website to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are all exciting topics in their own right, but bringing them
          all together in one webpage is like a party - the more, the merrier!
