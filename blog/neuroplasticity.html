        <h2>How can understanding neuroplasticity benefit us?</h2>

        <p>
          Knowing how your mind works can be really empowering - everyone at
          some stage in their life has felt like they just aren't capable of
          understanding something. Being aware that your brain can make new
          connections, and can develop over time in response to what you feed
          it, can empower you with the confidence to push through the challenges
          of learning a new skill. Understanding exactly how the brain makes
          these new connections, and how we can support our brains to become
          plastic more easily, allows us to make the most of our learning
          opportunities and learn effectively. Researching neuroplasticity
          allows us to build a gameplan of sorts for our learning, ensuring that
          our brain is stimulated in ways which work for us, gets regular
          consistent practice at the skill we're learning, and recieves good
          quality rest and proper nutrition.
        </p>

        <p>
          By being aware of your brain's potential to develop, you can help to
          reframe how you percieve yourself. If you've ever felt like you put
          limits on your learning by telling yourself that you don't have the
          capacity to change, and will always be stuck with the brain and
          knowledge you have, then knowing that your brain is malleable can
          inspire you to keep learning a new skill even through the toughest
          challenges.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>
          How can you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your
          benefit?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Personally, I will try to give my brain the best environment to
          plasticise! I'll prioritise getting a good sleep each night, getting
          regular exercise and eating nutritional foods to support my focus and
          learning. I'll also keep up a regular coding practice to keep working
          the new connections in my brain and solidify my learning by putting it
          into practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Knowing that my brain has the ability to change and improve over time
          is something I'll remind myself of when I face challenges during my
          learning. It's encouraging to know that getting stuck, or failing, is
          an opportunity to further my learning by understanding what went wrong
          and how to resolve it in the future. It's good to know that
          challenging myself creates an environment where my brain can focus in
          and learn better. I'm also very interested in the concept of
          visualising as a form of practice - I think I can apply this to my own
          learning by imagining what it would be like to already have a career
          in the tech industry, and what that could look like for me. This will
          set me up for success once I graduate this course and enter the
          industry for the first time.

        <h2>How can you increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>

        <p>
          Brain games are a good way to stimulate your mind and challenge it in
          new and diverse ways. Teasers, crosswords, sudokus, and more are all
          useful for improving executive function, and improving memory and
          processing speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning something new is a great way to build new connections in your
          brain. It can be coding, or playing an instrument, or learning a new
          language. You can also expand beyond these to throw yourself into new
          experiences - find a new social group, go travelling, try creating
          some art, read a new book, get imaginative.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mindfulness is a really useful tool for sharpening your focus and
          present awareness as you learn a new skill. It can help train your
          brain to stay on task and take in the content you are consuming.
        </p>

        <p>
          Physical wellness, such as getting enough good quality REM sleep,
          eating a good diet, and exercising regularly help your brain to cement
          its learning and supports it as it works in new ways. Sleep in
          particular solidifies your progress and boosts your brain's
          performance, giving it the space to recharge and retain your new
          knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reduce overall stress to help support your brain as it makes new
          connections. Stress can weaken brain-derived neurotropic factor
          (BDNF), which is responsible for growing new connections and
          inter-neuron signalling. By reducing and managing your stress, you can
          keep levels of BDNF in your brain high enough to keep boosting its
          neuroplasticity.

        <h2>What is a growth mindset and why is it relevant?</h2>

        <p>
          A growth mindset is the belief that you can change core aspects of
          yourself over time. This includes your personality, your intellectual
          abilities, and your self-beliefs. It means you strive to learn, adapt
          and change through challenges and obstacles, and that you see yourself
          as having the potential to improve beyond your current state of being.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having a growth mindset is in opposition to the fixed mindset. In a
          fixed mindset, people have the self-limiting belief that they were
          born with one personality and set of skills which they cannot change.
          Because they do not believe they are able to improve, they do not
          challenge themselves to do better, and end up stuck and unable to
          adapt positively to life's challenges. Realising that you can move
          beyond your current sense of self can be hugely motivational in
          improving aspects of your life which you aren't satisfied with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cultivating a growth mindset is relevant and important because it
          builds resilience in the face of challenge. As we take the risk of
          learning a new skill, including changing our lifestyle and our
          circumstances, believing that we can persevere and improve at this new
          skill keeps us confident in our abilities and our capacity to improve
          even when we suffer setbacks. A growth mindset fosters emotional
          resilience and fuels an inner drive to keep going, even when the going
          gets tough.

        <h2>
          Did anything surprise you or change for you as you explored this
          topic?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I went into this exercise having some familiarity with a growth
          mindset, but this exploration really helped me see how it relates to
          my own life experience. Until my mid-20s I was pretty convinced that I
          was only able to be good at creative and arts/humanities subjects, and
          my struggles in STEM subjects during high school reinforced my beliefs
          that my brain couldn't be good at anything outside the arts realm. I
          didn't realise at the time how much I was limiting myself with this
          mindset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Learning about the growth mindset has encouraged me to pursue other
          things I'm interested in outside of the arts, such as coding and other
          technicial areas. These are things I've always had an interest in, but
          never thought I could actually do well at. Knowing that I can adapt
          and improve has given me the confidence to actually challenge myself
          in these areas and to not be afraid of failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exploration has also made me reflect on my attitude to failure. I
          was terrified of failing when I was in school, and the way academic
          work is graded reinforced my belief that failure is a negative thing.
          It encouraged me to stay in my comfort zone and not take risks. Coming
          to study at Dev Academy has in itself been a big leap of faith and
          really challenged me in my fear. I'm now beginning to reframe failure
          as an opportunity to learn, rather than reinforcing the idea that I
          can't code.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>How can I integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey?</h2>
        <p>
          I plan to reframe my attitude to failure by seeing mistakes and
          problems as opportunities to learn what went wrong, and how I can grow
          my knowledge and understanding from this obstacle. As part of this,
          I'll exercise awareness about how I talk to myself when problems arise
          - encouraging myself to push through, rather than accepting defeat and
          thinking that I'm not cut out for this.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also plan to consciously encourage my brain's neuroplasticity to
          support my growth. I'll try to stimulate my brain through challenges,
          both in coding and in the form of puzzles and teasers, and through
          getting regular rest and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I'll also
          throw myself out of my comfort zone more and remind myself that
          challenges will lead to further growth and development.

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>
          How can my understandings around neuroplasticity and a growth mindset
          shape my learning plan for Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          My current learning plan incorporates daily exercise, so I will
          continue to keep that up. I will ensure I take breaks when I need them
          and spent some time on mindfulness daily to help my brain relax into
          its new learning. I will try to keep up coding daily to grow my
          understanding and confidence of the new material I'm learning. When I
          get stuck on problems I'll keep returning to them and trying to figure
          them out.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll also try some visualisation to support my practice, particularly
          trying to visualise key coding concepts. I think that could be a
          really interesting way to support my current learning.
