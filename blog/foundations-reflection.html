        <h2>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h2>

        <p>
          I've learnt that I actually have a lot more transferrable skills to
          programming than I originally thought. I went into this course
          thinking that my previous career in the arts wouldn't really help me
          out at all in this field, but I feel like my time working in a small
          team really helped me learn good human skills which align well with
          what we've learnt in Core.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also learnt which of my values and strengths align well with
          programming, and how I can use them to improve my code, along with now
          having self-awareness of my weaknesses and how they can potentially
          trip me up. I've seen an improvement in my ability to tough it out
          when things go wrong with my code, and I give up less easily because
          I'm now remembering to encourage myself. I'm also now remembering to
          take breaks more frequently now, because I know I can easily get
          sucked into a problem for too long.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, learning about neuroplasticity has been really enlightening
          and has helped me to understand how I can best support my brain as it
          learns. Alongside trying to code often, I've been playing some brain
          training games and solving puzzles to keep my brain working in a bunch
          of different ways.
        </p>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h2>

        <p>
          I think it's really important during any learning journey to be aware
          of your own values, particularly if it's going to initiate a career
          change. Wrestling with code can be really challenging, and there's
          nothing quite like stress to show you who you really are. During
          moments of stress and transition, thinking back to your root values
          and how they define you helps you centre yourself as you find the
          right path forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Empathy fosters our perception of others, and of the world around us.
          It helps us to improve our attention to detail, whether it's reading
          how someone is feeling, or where that little mistake is hidden in our
          code. It's not only a great skill to have if you're working as part of
          a team, but a really useful way to assess yourself and others during
          the process of coding and further learning. It also becomes important
          when pair programming with someone, as you work together to write good
          quality code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Self-awareness is vital for evaluating your own learning journey and
          your growing coding skills. Having a healthy awareness of yourself
          fosters a growth mindset as you consider how far you've come, and what
          you can do to improve further - both when it comes to your
          problem-solving abilities, and in the context of refactoring your
          code. This awareness and ability to know where you're at makes you a
          better overall learner and programmer. It's about learning smarter,
          not harder.

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I think what surprised me most was how much it resonated with a lot of
          my past explorations of myself, both alone and through guidance. It
          was reassuring to see that these explorations can help me on my
          journey to become a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also was pleasantly surprised by how much Core actually helped me
          improve my solo programming skills. I feel like I am much better under
          stress now when I'm in the thick of problem-solving code, and as a
          result I sometimes end up coming to a solution more easily because I'm
          not focused on panicking. I thought Core would mostly be useful when
          working with others, but it's been really helpful while working alone
          too.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

        <p>
          I found examining my own values and strengths surprisingly hard. That
          ended up being the most challenging aspect of Core for me, and it took
          me a while to write an exploration of my identity and values. While I
          often research self-improvement, I don't often examine myself quite as
          deeply as I needed to for that exercise. It was really useful.

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h2>

        <p>
          I think it's so much of a focus because programming isn't just about
          fingers on keyboards, writing code. It's also about how humans
          understand and working with the code, and how our brains develop and
          learn what is eseentially a logical language. Learning to code is
          hard, and focusing on Core makes sense for helping us to examine
          ourselves ahead of time so we can anticipate what we'll find
          challenging as we learn. Being prepared for challenge ahead of time
          can help to strengthen our resolve and prevent complete discouragement
          about our abilities. It also better prepares us for the job search
          afterwards, as employers are very much looking for human skills
          alongside coding ability. Coding is only one half of it - how you get
          on well with the team is just as important.

      <div class="paragraph-spacing">
        <h2>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>

        <p>
          Not at all! In fact, I think it's been a really crucial part of my
          learning during Foundations. Taking the time to focus on Core each
          week has helped me remember to check in with myself, which I've found
          so helpful during all the learning and problem-solving we've been
          doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I've done self-guided web development courses in the past, they
          taught me a lot about coding itself, but not as much about how to
          persevere through the emotional struggles and challenges of
          problem-solving code. I feel like I've really sharpened my
          problem-solving abilities just by learning how I react during
          difficult moments, and how I can temper that to help me push through
          and find a solution. Learning more about myself in the context of
          coding feels like it's going to set me up really well for embarking on
          a career in an industry which is brand new to me - i.e. the tech
          industry.
