          <p>
            My name is Hannah, and I'm joining Dev Academy Aotearoa from TƒÅmaki
            Makaurau Auckland. Previously I worked in the contemporary arts
            sector as a coordinator, after completing a postgraduate degree in
            Art History. It was through my time in the arts that I had the
            opportunity to work on building and maintaining a Wordpress website,
            and discovered my love for creating through code.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal when I graduate from Dev Academy is to work in the industry
            as a web developer, making and maintaining websites for clients and
            working as part of a development team. I love the opportunity to
            dive into a new challenge headfirst, learning as much as I can along
            the way. Alongside my previous work on websites, I had the pleasure
            of installing a lot of different audiovisual artworks for artists
            and project managed overall exhibition changeovers.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare time I love being outdoors, cooking new things,
            knitting, heading out on the water and visiting art galleries.
          </p>
